0. Write an empty class Square that defines a square:
1. Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)
2. Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)
3. Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)
4. Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)
5. Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)
6. Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)
7. Write a class Node that defines a node of a singly linked list by
   Private instance attribute: data:
property def data(self): to retrieve it
property setter def data(self, value): to set it:
data must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message data must be an integer
Private instance attribute: next_node:
property def next_node(self): to retrieve it
property setter def next_node(self, value): to set it:
next_node can be None or must be a Node, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message next_node must be a Node object
Instantiation with data and next_node: def __init__(self, data, next_node=None):
And, write a class SinglyLinkedList that defines a singly linked list by:

Private instance attribute: head (no setter or getter)
Simple instantiation: def __init__(self):
Should be printable:
print the entire list in stdout
one node number by line
Public instance method: def sorted_insert(self, value): that inserts a new Node into the correct sorted position in the list (increasing order)
